## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- jQuery library

### What I learned

In this challenge, I was able to understand in a practical way the construction of a slightly more complex layout, including more different sections, and organizing differently for mobile than the desktop version.

The two systems Flexbox and Grid came in handy, which combined together gave life to the structure of each part of the site.
